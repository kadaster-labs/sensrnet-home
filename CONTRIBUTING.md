# The SensRNet Contribution Guide

The SensRNet project aims to start and support the development of a National Sensor Registry (see our [Product Vision](https://github.com/kadaster-labs/sensrnet-home/blob/master/docs/ProductVision.md)) in The Netherlands. While the future National Sensor Registry product is owned and maintained by a consortium, the SensRNet project is intended as (and will stay) an open source project. Contribution to this project is started by a group of developers at Kadaster but the aim is to get as many contributors as possible in the future.

Thus we appreciate your input, enjoy feedback and welcome improvements to this project and are very open to collaboration. Therefore we love issues and pull requests from everyone.

## Problems, suggestions and questions in issues
Please help development by reporting problems, suggesting changes and asking questions. To do this, you can [create a GitHub issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue) for this project.
You don’t need to change any of our code or documentation to be a contributor!

## Documentation and code in pull requests
If you want to add to the documentation or code of one of our projects you should make a pull request.
If you never used GitHub, get up to speed with [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) or follow one of the great free interactive courses in the [GitHub learning lab](https://lab.github.com/) on working with GitHub and working with [MarkDown](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/communicating-using-markdown), the syntax this project’s documentation is in.

This project is licensed under the [European Union Public Licence](https://eupl.eu/), also available [here](https://github.com/kadaster-labs/sensrnet-home/blob/master/LICENSE.md) in MarkDown, English and Dutch.

### 1. Make your changes
This project uses the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and contributors are requested to use [Fork & Pull](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-collaborative-development-models) creating a personal copy of an existing repository. You can push changes to your personal fork and after a pull request the changes can (eventually) be pulled into the source repository by the project maintainer.

Please add your changes in commits [with a message that explains them](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message). Document choices or decisions you make in the commit message, this will enable everyone to be informed of your choices in the future.

Please make sure you’ve added and updated the relevant documentation and tests before you submit your pull request. Make sure to write tests that show the behavior of the newly added or changed code.

### 2. Pull request
When submitting the pull request, please accompany it with a description of the problem you are trying to solve and the issue numbers that this pull request fixes.

### 3. Improve
All contributions have to be reviewed by someone.
It could be that your contribution can be merged immediately by a maintainer. However, usually, a new pull request needs some improvements before it can be merged. Other contributors (or helper robots) might have feedback. If this is the case the reviewing maintainer will help you improve your documentation and code.
If your documentation and code have passed human review, it is merged.

### 4. Celebrate
Your ideas, documentation and code are very much appreciated and will become an integral part of this project. You are the open source hero we need!
