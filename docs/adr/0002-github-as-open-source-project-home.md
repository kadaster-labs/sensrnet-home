# GitHub as Open Source Project Home

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a location to manage and publish our code.
It needs to be easy to find, standard for Kadaster and other governmental organizations.

## Considered Options

* [GitHub.com](https://github.com) - Leading and mainstream open source version control platform, but commercially driven
* [Gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) - Leading alternative being more open source itself and used by [VNG/Common Ground](https://gitlab.com/commonground)

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "GitHub.com", because

* this the default for Kadaster and Kadaster is the organization asked to start this (open source) project
* GitHub can be considered as the main open source platform
* Gitlab would have requested extra effort for costs and accounting
* This decision might be reconsidered when the governance and responsibilities are changing of this open source project

### Consequences

* [github.com/kadaster-labs/sensrnet-home](https://github.com/kadaster-labs/sensrnet-home) is chosen as the main entry point for the documentation
* all repositories follow the naming convention `sensrnet-*` where `*` stands for the wildcard of the names of components
